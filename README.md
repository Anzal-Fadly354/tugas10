# Login UI Design

A Flutter project that gives basic flutter design to implement a login UI.

## Getting Started

This project demonstrates a widget to make a fully functioning login UI.\
Please integrate database or other things on your own. I hardcorded the credentials.
```
Username: username

```
They are case sensitive.

For a password to be password compliant, it needs to have:
```
- Uppercase characters
- Digits
- Lowercase characters
- Special characters
- Minimum length of 6
```
